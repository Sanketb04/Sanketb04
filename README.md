# Hi, I'm Sanket Bhagat👋

## 🚀 Data Engineer | Database Developer | Big Data Innovator 🚀

I’m a passionate Data Engineer with a strong interest in transforming raw data into meaningful insights through cloud-based, scalable, and automated data pipelines.

I specialize in designing and developing ETL/ELT workflows, serverless data architectures, and real-time analytics solutions on AWS and Azure. With expertise in tools like AWS Glue, Lambda, Redshift, S3, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and PySpark, I love building systems that empower data-driven decision-making.

In today’s world, data is the new oil, and as a data engineer, I strive to refine and process it to fuel innovation and intelligence. My experience spans across handling large-scale datasets in formats like CSV, Parquet, and JSON, integrating APIs, and orchestrating data workflows in multi-cloud environments.

I’m constantly exploring AI-driven data engineering, automation, and big data frameworks to create smarter and more efficient data ecosystems.
